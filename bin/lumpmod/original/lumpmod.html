<h1>LumpMod v0.21</h1>
<p>LumpMod is a small command-line utility for working with lumps in wad
files in the format used by DOOM and DOOM 2. It can add, delete, extract,
rename, list, and update individual lumps. It can also add sections
(XX_START and XX_END, for instance) and delete entire sections.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p><tt>lumpmod [wadfile] [command] [-s section] [parameters]</tt></p>
<p>Sections are MAPxx (xx = 01-99, where that map exists in the file), ExMy
(x, y = 1-9, where that map exists in the file), and anything else will be
the section between WHATEVER_START and WHATEVER_END. Sections that do not
exist in the wad file cannot be used. The section part can be left out to
work with the whole file. Any section specified here while using the addsect
or delsect commands will cause an error.</p>
<p>Note that the []... parameters in the command listings can be repeated.
For example, you can use <tt>lumpmod clowns.wad add CLOWNS clowns.lmp</tt> to
add a CLOWNS lump, or <tt>lumpmod clowns.wad add CLOWN1 clown1.lmp CLOWN2
clown2.lmp</tt> to add two clown-related lumps.</p>
<p>Note also that lump names and commands are case sensitive. There is an
<tt>update</tt> command, but no <tt>UPDATE</tt> command.</p>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<p><tt>add [-a lumpname] [-b] [-d] [-n] [LUMPNAME FILENAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Add a lump to the end of the wad, or after the lump specified with the -a
option. If the lump already exists, it will be overwritten (with its position
unchanged) unless the -n option is specified, in which case no action will be
taken, or the -d option is specified, in which case an additional lump with
the same name will be added. If the lump specified in the -a option does not
exist, an error will occur. The -b option will add the lump at the beginning,
overriding the -a option.</p>
<p><tt>addsect [SECTNAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Add a section. The name must be one or two characters long. If section
name is HX, zero-length entries HX_START and HX_END will be added to the end
of the wad file. If this section already exists, no action will be taken.</p>
<p><tt>delete [LUMPNAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Remove LUMPNAME from the wad.</p>
<p><tt>delsect [SECTNAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Delete a section and anything inside it. If the section doesn't exist, no
action will be taken.</p>
<p><tt>extract [LUMPNAME FILENAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Save the contents of LUMPNAME to the file named FILENAME. (Wad file will
not be changed in any way.)</p>
<p><tt>list [-v]</tt></p>
<p>List all lumps in the wad, in the order they appear in the directory.
With the -v option, include numbers and lump lengths.</p>
<p><tt>rename [OLDNAME NEWNAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Rename a lump in the wad.</p>
<p><tt>update [LUMPNAME FILENAME]...</tt></p>
<p>Update LUMPNAME with the contents of FILENAME. If no lump named LUMPNAME
exists in the wad, no action will be taken.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Version 0.21 adds the -d option to the add command.</p>
<p>Version 0.2 contains a fix to a bug involving empty sections. The initial
public release was version 0.1.</p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>LumpMod currently chokes on completely empty wad files (i.e., those that
contain absolutely no lumps). Let me know if you find any other bugs.</p>
