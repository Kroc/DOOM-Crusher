- Bump rayon to 1.0 ([#99](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/pull/99) @cuviper)
- Bump minor versions of other dependencies for binary distribution

### Version 1.0.0

- Remove the C dependency on miniz, and replace it with a Rust version ([#57](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/57))
  - This improves decompression speed by 15%. Compression speed is not affected.
  - [SEMVER_MAJOR] This also obsoletes the `-zm` command line option and the `memory` key on the `Options` struct.
  - Presets will be updated automatically. This means that presets 3 and higher will run significantly more quickly.
- [SEMVER_MAJOR] Adjust the presets, now that `-zm` is no longer an option.
  - `-o3` now tests all filter types. This will result in 50% more trials than before, but may give up to 10% more compression gain.
  - `-o4` and higher now test all alpha optimization types. This adds 5 trials specific to the alpha channel. Only transparent images are affected.
- Implement unix-specific permissions copying for `-p` option
- Performance optimizations
- Refactor of internal code

### Version 0.19.0

- [SEMVER_MAJOR] Default to overwriting the input file if `out_file` is not set.
  This does not affect the CLI, but with the library, it was easy to forget to set the `out_file`,
  and there was no warning that no output file would be written.
- Bump dependencies, reduces binary size by a considerable amount
- Hide all modules from documentation, and only export the specific structures that should be public.
  Previously there were too many implementation details made public. The modules are still public for the purposes of our integration tests,
  but we strongly advise against using undocumented modules. These may become private in the future.
- Internal refactoring and code cleanup
- Fix an error message that was displaying the wrong file path
- Fix an issue where the output file would not be written if the input was already optimized,
  even if the output path was different from the input path

### Version 0.18.3

### Version 0.17.1

- Remove VC++ download requirement for Windows users

### Version 0.17.0

- [SEMVER_MAJOR] Bump minimum required rustc version to 1.19.0
- [SEMVER_MINOR] Oxipng will now, by default, attempt to change all transparent pixels to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` to improve compression.
  It does fast trials with filters 0 and 5 to see if this is an improvement over
  the existing alpha channel.
- [SEMVER_MINOR] Add a `-a` option to the command line (`alphas` in the struct) which enables 6 different
  trials for optimizing the alpha channel, using the previously mentioned fast heuristic.
  This option will make optimization of images with transparency somewhat slower,
  but may improve compression.
- Fixed a bug in reducing palettes for images with bit depth of two ([#80](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/80))
- Fixed another bug in reducing palettes for images with bit depth less than eight ([#82](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/issues/82))
