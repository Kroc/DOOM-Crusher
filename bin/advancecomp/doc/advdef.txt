2 DESCRIPTION
=============

The main purpose of this utility is to recompress the
data present in the .png, .mng, .gz, .tgz and .svgz
files.

The internal structure of the files isn't changed.
Only the compressed data is modified.


3 OPTIONS
=========

    -z, --recompress FILES...
        Recompress the specified files. If the -1, -2, -3, -4
        options are specified it's used the smallest file
        choice from the previous compressed data and the
        new compression. If the -0 option is specified the
        file is always rewritten without any compression.

    -0, --shrink-store
        Disable the compression. The file is
        only stored and not compressed. The file is always
        rewritten also if it's bigger.

    -1, --shrink-fast
        Set the compression level to "fast" using the zlib
        compressor.

    -2, --shrink-normal
        Set the compression level to "normal" using the libdeflate
        compressor.
        This is the default level of compression.

    -3, --shrink-extra
        Set the compression level to "extra" using the 7z
        compressor.
        You can define the compressor iterations with
        the -i, --iter option.

    -4, --shrink-insane
        Set the compression level to "insane" using the zopfli
        compressor.
        You can define the compressor iterations with
        the -i, --iter option.

    -i, --iter N
        Define an additional numer of iterations for the 7z and zopfli
        compressors for modes -3 and -4.
        More iterations usually give a better compression, but may
        require a lot more time.
        Try for example with 10, 15, 20, and so on.

    -f, --force
        Force the use of the new file also if it's bigger.


4 LIMITATIONS
=============

The advdef program cannot be used to recompress huge files
because it needs to allocate memory for both the complete
compressed and uncompressed data.
