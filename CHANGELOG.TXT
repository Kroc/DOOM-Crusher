v1.1    13-JAN-17
-       Skip files that have already been crushed before
        (a cache of file hashes is kept in `bin\hashes.txt`)
-       WADPTR's sidedef packing is disabled to prevent glitches in maps
-       Added `/NOPK3` and `/NOWAD` options to ignore these types
-       Added `/ZSTORE` option to repack the PK3s *without* compression:
        Whilst the PK3 file will be larger than before, it will boot faster.
	If you are compressing a number of PK3s together, then using /ZSTORE
        on them might drastically improve the final size of .7Z and .RAR
        archives when using a very large dictionary size (256 MB or more)
-       Fixes for file size reduction reporting
