v2.1    ?


v2.0    09-MAR-19
-       Complete rewrite
-       Switched to faster SHA1 checksums (existing cache files will be invalid)
-       Files that error are added to a separate hash cache to ignore next time
-       Recognize ".iwad" & ".ipk3" files
-       Fixes for file and lump names containing special characters,
        especially spaces
-       WadPtr has been updated to 2.4, improves reliability with large WADs
-       "Thumbs.db", "Desktop.ini", ".git*" and ".DS_STORE" files
        are always ignored / removed from PK3 files
-       Added /NOCACHE option to always process files
-       /ECHO option will enable ECHO throughout
        (helps debugging syntax / expansion errors)
-       Replaced percentage diff with bytes

v1.2    21-JAN-17
-       Fixed options not applying!
-       Many major fixes and improvements to caching:
        
        +       If skipping PNG/JPG files, allow a PK3/WAD to be added
                to the cache if does not contain any such files
        +       Separate hashes into different buckets for file-type,
                this resolves the issue `/ZSTORE` not repacking PK3s
                that had been maximally compressed and cached
        +       A "cache" folder is now used. Your existing "hashes.txt"
                will be invalid due to critical bugs in v1.1, sorry :(
        
-       Fixes and improvements to filesize and percentage reporting
-       Added basic logging (a replica of what appears on screen), see "bin\log.txt",
        more advanced logging is planned which will capture full error details
-       Signigicantly faster WAD processing
        (lumpmod modified to identify PNG/JPG lumps, with thanks to _mental_)
-       Faster PK3 processing

v1.1    13-JAN-17
-       Skip files that have already been crushed before
        (a cache of file hashes is kept in `bin\hashes.txt`)
-       WADPTR's sidedef packing is disabled to prevent glitches in maps
-       Added `/NOPK3` and `/NOWAD` options to ignore these types
-       Added `/ZSTORE` option to repack the PK3s *without* compression:
        Whilst the PK3 file will be larger than before, it will boot faster.
	If you are compressing a number of PK3s together, then using /ZSTORE
        on them might drastically improve the final size of .7Z and .RAR
        archives when using a very large dictionary size (256 MB or more)
-       Fixes for file size reduction reporting

v1.0.1  17-DEC-16
-       Fixed WADs being processed twice in a row

v1.0    14-DEC-16
-       Initial release
